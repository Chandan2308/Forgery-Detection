                    <p>3. Authentication in Personal Transactions: For personal financial transactions such as signing checks, transferring property, or applying for loans, signature verification provides an extra layer of security to verify that you're the one authorizing the transaction.</p>
                    
                    
                  <p> 4. Digital Transactions: With the rise of e-signatures, individuals need verification methods that ensure their digital signatures are protected and recognized as authentic, especially in online contracts or e-commerce.</p>
